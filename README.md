## Project Background

MapleTech, a global e-commerce company founded in 2017, specializes in selling premium electronics and accessories such as JBL, Apple, Anker, and ASUS products. I’m collaborating with the Head of Business Strategy to extract data-driven insights and deliver actionable recommendations to improve performance across sales, product lines, customer retention, and marketing channels.

## Executive Summary

MapleTech’s sales analysis of almost 113k records from 2019-2022 reveals total revenue of $61.9 million, with a peak in 2020 followed by a 24% decline by 2022. North America and Europe dominate sales, while Asia and South America remain smaller markets with growth potential. Products like JBL Earbuds, Anker Chargers, and ASUS Displays contribute 72% of total revenue, but customer retention is a concern as unique customers and repeat purchases have declined by 12% and 9%, respectively. MapleTech can boost growth by expanding its top product lines, optimizing the loyalty program, and enhancing marketing efforts in underutilized channels like affiliates and social media. Improving mobile app engagement and targeting growth in Asia and South America can further strengthen MapleTech’s market position.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Sales Trends and Growth Rates

- MapleTech averages $15.5 million in annual sales with approximately 28,000 orders per year between 2019 and 2022. Sales more than doubled in 2020, growing by 105% compared to 2019, driven by the surge in remote work and digital adoption during the pandemic. However, sales began tapering off post-pandemic, with an 8% decline in 2021 and an additional 18% drop in 2022, bringing annual revenue down to $14.8 million, though still above pre-pandemic levels.
- The company exhibits clear seasonality, with peak sales occurring in November and December, especially driven by holiday and promotional periods, while February and October consistently record lower revenues. Monthly trends show pronounced spikes in Q4 across all years, aligning with global shopping events.
- MapleTech’s Average Order Value (AOV) steadily increased from $490 in 2019 to $589 in 2022, reflecting a shift towards higher-value purchases even as overall order volume decreased. Order count growth peaked at 87% in 2020, followed by declines of 12% in 2021 and 21% in 2022, indicating challenges in sustaining customer demand post-pandemic.
- Regionally, North America and Europe dominate sales contributions, with emerging yet volatile growth observed in Asia and South America during the pandemic period. These regions present further opportunities for stabilization and growth through targeted strategies.

### Product Performance

- During the pandemic, MapleTech saw significant sales concentration around premium accessories and audio devices. The JBL Live Pro+ Earbuds emerged as the highest revenue generator, contributing $19 million or 31% of total revenue. Similarly, Anker USB-C Chargers and ASUS ProArt Displays became major revenue drivers, accounting for 23% and 18% of total sales, respectively.
- Collectively, these top three products — JBL Earbuds, Anker Chargers, and ASUS Displays — contribute 72% of total revenue, highlighting MapleTech’s dependence on a limited product mix. In contrast, products like the Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones and LG UltraFine 5K Monitor underperform, each contributing less than 1% of revenue despite moderate order volumes.
- The MacBook Air Laptop, while leading in order volume with 28,398 units (25% of all orders), generates only 18% of total revenue due to its comparatively lower Average Order Value (AOV) of $391. In contrast, Anker Chargers and ASUS Displays boast AOVs above $1,000, reflecting their premium positioning.
- This skewed revenue concentration suggests an opportunity for MapleTech to expand its successful product categories while re-evaluating low-contribution items to optimize profitability and inventory strategies.

### Loyalty Program Performance

- Loyalty members consistently outperform non-loyalty customers across key metrics, though the gap has narrowed post-pandemic. Between 2019 and 2022, loyalty members generated $27.6 million in revenue, while non-loyalty customers contributed $34.2 million. Despite the revenue gap, loyalty members achieved a higher Average Order Value (AOV) of $551 compared to $546 for non-loyalty customers.
- Loyalty sales grew rapidly during the pandemic, peaking in 2020 with a 118% growth rate, compared to 96% growth for non-loyalty sales. However, both segments saw negative growth after 2020, with loyalty sales declining by 12% in 2022, and non-loyalty sales dropping 23%.
- In terms of order count, loyalty members placed 50,211 orders, while non-loyalty customers placed 62,688 orders. Loyalty customers also maintained a more stable order volume, experiencing smaller declines than non-loyalty members post-pandemic.
- Refund rates remain identical between segments, averaging 10% for both loyalty and non-loyalty purchases across the period — indicating that loyalty participation did not negatively impact product satisfaction or returns.
- While the loyalty program has driven higher spending per order, MapleTech can further enhance its effectiveness by refining incentives and re-engagement strategies, especially as growth rates have slowed since 2021.

### Sales by Platforms & Marketing Channels

- The direct channel dominates MapleTech’s sales, contributing 83% ($51.3M) of total revenue. Email campaigns are the second-largest driver, accounting for 12% ($7.4M), while affiliate channels contribute 3% ($1.8M). Social media remains underutilized, generating only 1% ($621K) of total sales.
- In terms of Average Order Value (AOV), the email channel leads with an AOV of $555, closely followed by direct and affiliate channels, both around $544-$547. Social media trails slightly at $546, while the unclassified (blank) channel matches the email AOV.
- From a platform perspective, the website drives 97.4% ($60.3M) of total revenue with an AOV of $551, while the mobile app contributes just 2.6% ($1.6M) with a lower AOV of $470. The app also trails significantly in order volume, with only 3,419 orders compared to 109,511 on the website.
- These trends highlight opportunities for MapleTech to enhance affiliate and social media strategies and to optimize the mobile app experience to increase its sales contribution and average order value.

### Refund Rates Impact Based on Loyalty

- Refund rates at MapleTech peaked in 2020 and 2021, coinciding with pandemic-driven demand surges. Both loyalty and non-loyalty customers recorded a 12% refund rate during these years, compared to 6% in 2019 and 2022, indicating that post-pandemic purchase stability helped reduce returns.
- Across the full period, the overall refund rate averages 10% for both loyalty and non-loyalty segments, suggesting that loyalty participation did not lead to increased returns. The highest refund counts occurred in 2020, with non-loyalty customers recording 2,493 refunds and loyalty members 1,857 refunds.
- Refund volumes stabilized in 2022, with both segments showing approximately 6% refund rates, returning to pre-pandemic levels. This improvement reflects operational enhancements in product quality and customer satisfaction initiatives.

## Recommendations

### Maximizing Product Offerings

- Expand High-Performing Categories: Increase product variations in JBL Earbuds, Anker USB-C Chargers, and ASUS ProArt Displays, which together contribute 72% of total revenue. Focus on bundling accessories with premium products to encourage higher basket sizes and repeat purchases.
- Optimize Low-Performing Products: Reevaluate pricing and promotion strategies for products like the Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones and LG UltraFine 5K Monitor, which contribute less than 1% of total revenue despite decent order volumes.

### Customer Growth and Retention

- Boost Repeat Purchases: Develop targeted re-engagement campaigns for customers with single purchases, leveraging loyalty data to create personalized incentives. Introduce tiered rewards within the loyalty program to encourage higher frequency of purchases.
- Revitalize Customer Acquisition: Strengthen underutilized marketing channels, particularly affiliate (3% of sales) and social media (1%), by partnering with influencers and offering enhanced commission rates. This will diversify acquisition efforts beyond the dominant direct channel (83% of sales).
- Leverage Core Customer Insights: Analyze purchasing behaviors of loyalty members, who show a higher AOV ($551 vs $546 for non-loyalty), to tailor marketing messages and drive upselling strategies.

### Loyalty Program Enhancements

- Enhance Loyalty Onboarding: Launch onboarding initiatives such as first-purchase discounts or exclusive early access offers for new loyalty members. Focus on maintaining the program’s strong engagement to offset the sales decline post-2020.
- Data-Driven Program Refinement: Continuously monitor loyalty metrics and segment customers by purchase patterns to refine rewards and communication, ensuring loyalty-driven revenue remains resilient.

### Maintaining Low Refund Rates

- Sustain Successful Practices: Maintain low refund rates by replicating strategies from 2019 and 2022, where refunds stabilized at 6%. This includes maintaining strict quality control, improving product descriptions, and offering robust post-purchase support.

### Optimizing Channels and Platforms

- Expand Affiliate and Social Media Strategies: Scale affiliate partnerships and incentivize social media marketing to lift sales contributions beyond their current minimal share.
- Enhance Mobile App Experience: Invest in improving the mobile app experience, where AOV is currently $470 — significantly lower than the website’s $551. Enhancements in checkout, personalization, and exclusive app deals could increase both order volume and value.

### Regional Growth Strategies

- Focus on High-Performing Regions: Continue investing in North America and Europe, the primary sales drivers, with region-specific promotions and inventory strategies.
- Target Emerging Regions: Design tailored marketing efforts for Asia and South America, which, while smaller, have shown growth potential during the pandemic years.

## Questions, Assumptions and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

**Unmatched customer_id Records**
- What percentage of orders lack a corresponding customer_id in the customers table? Is this due to data integration gaps, guest checkouts, or legacy data?
- Which table should serve as the primary source of truth for customer data to ensure consistency across sales, loyalty, and marketing analyses?

**Marketing Channel Attribution**
- How is the marketing_channel field captured in the dataset? Does it represent the customer’s first acquisition channel, or is it linked to the specific channel for each purchase?
- Is there a deterministic relationship between marketing_channel and account_creation_method? If so, should this fixed mapping be revisited to reflect multiple touchpoints in a customer journey?

**Loyalty Program Consistency**
- Is the loyalty_program flag assigned at the account level or on a per-order basis?
- Can a customer switch between loyalty and non-loyalty status across different purchases, or is membership status fixed once enrolled?
- What incentives are currently tied to the loyalty program, and are they dynamically adjusted based on purchase frequency?

### Assumptions and Caveats

- **Refund Records Completeness**: Refund data appears comprehensive, with both loyalty and non-loyalty customers showing a consistent overall refund rate of 10%. However, refund percentages held constant across loyalty tiers — this may indicate uniform return policies, but warrants validation with operational teams.
- **Deterministic Data Mapping**: A one-to-one relationship is observed between marketing channels and account creation methods, which limits insights on multi-channel impacts across a customer’s lifecycle. This static mapping may restrict advanced attribution modeling and should be verified with data engineering.
- **Loyalty Program Interpretation**: The dataset does not clarify whether the loyalty_program flag changes over time per customer. This ambiguity affects the analysis of repeat purchase behavior and loyalty-driven performance. Clarification is needed on whether a user’s loyalty status is permanent post-enrollment.
- **Attribution of Purchases to Channels**: Current data reflects only the initial account creation channel, not the channel directly influencing each transaction. This limits accurate channel-level sales attribution.
  - Direct Channel: Accounts for 83% of total sales.
  - Email Channel: Contributes 12% of sales, with a relatively higher AOV of $555.
  - Understanding if loyalty membership rates differ by channel would further enrich targeting strategies.
- **Unmatched Customer Records**: The potential presence of unmatched customer_ids across orders and customers tables may impact the robustness of join operations in SQL-based analyses.
- **Platform Performance Consistency**: The mobile app continues to underperform compared to the website — contributing only 2.6% of total sales with a lower AOV of $470. Future app enhancements could address this gap, but user engagement data by platform was not fully available in the current dataset.
