      <h2 align="center">Executive Summary</h2>
      <body>
        MapleTech’s sales analysis of almost <strong>113k records</strong> from 2019-2022 reveals total revenue of <strong>$61.9 million</strong>, with a peak in 2020 followed by a 24% decline by 2022. North America and Europe dominate sales, while Asia and South America remain smaller markets with growth potential.<br>
        <br>
        Products like <strong>JBL Earbuds, Anker Chargers, and ASUS Displays</strong> contribute 72% of total revenue, but customer retention is a concern as unique customers and repeat purchases have declined by 12% and 9%, respectively. MapleTech can boost growth by expanding its top product lines, optimizing the loyalty program, and enhancing marketing efforts in underutilized channels like affiliates and social media. Improving mobile app engagement and targeting growth in Asia and South America can further strengthen MapleTech’s market position.

      <h3>Maximizing Product Offerings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expand High Performers:</strong> Expand high-performing categories like JBL Earbuds, Anker Chargers, and ASUS Displays (72% of revenue) by introducing product variations and bundling strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix Low Performers:</strong> Optimize or reposition low-performing products such as Sony WH-1000XM5 and LG UltraFine 5K Monitor by reassessing pricing and promotional tactics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Customer Growth and Retention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Re-engagement:</strong> Boost repeat purchases by launching campaigns for one-time buyers using loyalty data for personalized incentives.</li>
        <li><strong>Channel Diversification:</strong> Revitalize acquisition channels like affiliate (3% of sales) and social media (1%) to reduce reliance on the direct channel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Loyalty Program Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Launch onboarding initiatives such as first-purchase discounts or exclusive early access offers for new loyalty members.</li>
        <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> Continuously monitor loyalty metrics to ensure loyalty-driven revenue remains resilient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Optimizing Channels and Platforms</h3>

      <h2 align="center">Questions, Assumptions and Caveats</h2>
      
      <h3>Questions for Stakeholders</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unmatched Records:</strong> What percentage of orders lack a corresponding customer_id? Which table is the source of truth?</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing Attribution:</strong> How is the marketing_channel field captured? Is there a deterministic relationship between marketing_channel and account_creation_method?</li>
        <li><strong>Loyalty Logic:</strong> Is the loyalty_program flag assigned at the account level or per-order? Can a customer switch status?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Assumptions and Caveats</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refund Records:</strong> Refund data appears comprehensive (10% rate), but constant percentages across tiers warrant validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic Data Mapping:</strong> A one-to-one relationship is observed between marketing channels and account creation methods, limiting multi-channel insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Loyalty Program Interpretation:</strong> The dataset does not clarify if loyalty status changes over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform Consistency:</strong> The mobile app continues to underperform compared to the website.</li>
      </ul>
