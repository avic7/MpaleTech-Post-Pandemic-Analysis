## Project Background

MapleTech, a global e-commerce company founded in 2017, specializes in selling premium electronics and accessories such as JBL, Apple, Anker, and ASUS products. I’m collaborating with the Head of Business Strategy to extract data-driven insights and deliver actionable recommendations to improve performance across sales, product lines, customer retention, and marketing channels.

## Executive Summary

MapleTech’s sales analysis of almost 113k records from 2019-2022 reveals total revenue of $61.9 million, with a peak in 2020 followed by a 24% decline by 2022. North America and Europe dominate sales, while Asia and South America remain smaller markets with growth potential. Products like JBL Earbuds, Anker Chargers, and ASUS Displays contribute 72% of total revenue, but customer retention is a concern as unique customers and repeat purchases have declined by 12% and 9%, respectively. MapleTech can boost growth by expanding its top product lines, optimizing the loyalty program, and enhancing marketing efforts in underutilized channels like affiliates and social media. Improving mobile app engagement and targeting growth in Asia and South America can further strengthen MapleTech’s market position.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Sales Trends and Growth Rates

- Sales surged 105% in 2020 during the pandemic boom, but declined by 8% in 2021 and 18% in 2022 — settling at $14.8M, still above pre-pandemic levels.
- Clear seasonality emerged, with consistent Q4 spikes (Nov–Dec) driven by holiday events, while February and October remained slow months.
- Average Order Value (AOV) rose from $490 to $589 between 2019–2022, even as order volume dropped — reflecting a shift toward higher-ticket purchases.
- North America and Europe led in sales, but Asia and South America showed volatile growth, highlighting potential for expansion through localized strategies.

### Product Performance

- JBL Live Pro+ Earbuds led product sales, contributing $19M (31% of revenue), with Anker USB-C Chargers and ASUS ProArt Displays adding 23% and 18% respectively — showing strong demand for premium accessories and audio gear.
- Top 3 products account for 72% of total revenue, revealing MapleTech’s reliance on a narrow product mix. Underperformers like Sony WH-1000XM5 and LG UltraFine 5K each contributed under 1% despite moderate sales.
- MacBook Air had the highest order volume (28,398 units, 25% of orders) but lower AOV ($391), generating only 18% of revenue — unlike Anker and ASUS products with AOVs above $1,000.
- Skewed revenue distribution signals an opportunity to double down on high performers and reassess low-yield products to improve profitability and optimize inventory.

### Loyalty Program Performance

- Loyalty members generated $27.6M in revenue (vs. $34.2M from non-loyalty) between 2019–2022, while maintaining a higher AOV of $551 compared to $546 — though the performance gap has narrowed post-pandemic.
- Loyalty sales peaked with 118% growth in 2020, outpacing the 96% growth of non-loyalty customers. However, by 2022, both segments declined — loyalty sales dropped 12%, non-loyalty fell 23%.
- Loyalty members placed 50,211 orders vs. 62,688 from non-loyalty customers. Despite fewer orders, loyalty users showed more stable order volumes during the post-pandemic decline.
- Refund rates averaged 10% for both groups, showing no negative impact from loyalty participation on product satisfaction or returns.
- To boost loyalty effectiveness, MapleTech should refine program incentives and re-engagement strategies, especially as growth momentum has slowed since 2021.

### Sales by Platforms & Marketing Channels

- The direct channel dominates MapleTech’s sales, contributing 83% ($51.3M) of total revenue. Email campaigns are the second-largest driver, accounting for 12% ($7.4M), while affiliate channels contribute 3% ($1.8M). Social media remains underutilized, generating only 1% ($621K) of total sales.
- In terms of Average Order Value (AOV), the email channel leads with an AOV of $555, closely followed by direct and affiliate channels, both around $544-$547. Social media trails slightly at $546, while the unclassified (blank) channel matches the email AOV.
- From a platform perspective, the website drives 97.4% ($60.3M) of total revenue with an AOV of $551, while the mobile app contributes just 2.6% ($1.6M) with a lower AOV of $470. The app also trails significantly in order volume, with only 3,419 orders compared to 109,511 on the website.
- These trends highlight opportunities for MapleTech to enhance affiliate and social media strategies and to optimize the mobile app experience to increase its sales contribution and average order value.

### Refund Rates Impact Based on Loyalty

- Refund rates peaked at 12% in 2020 and 2021 for both loyalty and non-loyalty customers, reflecting pandemic-related volatility. Rates dropped to 6% in 2019 and 2022, signaling restored purchase stability.
- Overall refund rate averaged 10% across all segments, with no significant difference between loyalty and non-loyalty customers — confirming that loyalty participation did not increase return risk.
- Refund volumes normalized in 2022, with both groups returning to 6% refund rates. This trend reflects improvements in product quality and customer satisfaction post-pandemic.

## Recommendations

### Maximizing Product Offerings

- Expand high-performing categories like JBL Earbuds, Anker Chargers, and ASUS Displays which drive 72% of total revenue by introducing product variations and bundling strategies to boost basket size and repeat purchases.
- Optimize or reposition low-performing products such as Sony WH-1000XM5 and LG UltraFine 5K Monitor by reassessing pricing, promotional tactics, and inventory alignment to improve their contribution.



### Customer Growth and Retention

- Boost repeat purchases by launching re-engagement campaigns for one-time buyers, using loyalty data to craft personalized incentives and introducing tiered rewards to drive purchase frequency.
- Revitalize acquisition channels like affiliate (3% of sales) and social media (1%) through influencer partnerships and improved commission structures  reducing reliance on the dominant direct channel (83%).
- Leverage loyalty purchasing insights to tailor marketing strategies and upsell opportunities, capitalizing on the higher AOV among loyalty members ($551 vs. $546).

### Loyalty Program Enhancements

- Enhance Loyalty Onboarding: Launch onboarding initiatives such as first-purchase discounts or exclusive early access offers for new loyalty members. Focus on maintaining the program’s strong engagement to offset the sales decline post-2020.
- Data-Driven Program Refinement: Continuously monitor loyalty metrics and segment customers by purchase patterns to refine rewards and communication, ensuring loyalty-driven revenue remains resilient.

### Maintaining Low Refund Rates

- Sustain Successful Practices: Maintain low refund rates by replicating strategies from 2019 and 2022, where refunds stabilized at 6%. This includes maintaining strict quality control, improving product descriptions, and offering robust post-purchase support.

### Optimizing Channels and Platforms

- Expand Affiliate and Social Media Strategies: Scale affiliate partnerships and incentivize social media marketing to lift sales contributions beyond their current minimal share.
- Enhance Mobile App Experience: Invest in improving the mobile app experience, where AOV is currently $470 — significantly lower than the website’s $551. Enhancements in checkout, personalization, and exclusive app deals could increase both order volume and value.

### Regional Growth Strategies

- Focus on High-Performing Regions: Continue investing in North America and Europe, the primary sales drivers, with region-specific promotions and inventory strategies.
- Target Emerging Regions: Design tailored marketing efforts for Asia and South America, which, while smaller, have shown growth potential during the pandemic years.

## Questions, Assumptions and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement

**Unmatched customer_id Records**
- What percentage of orders lack a corresponding customer_id in the customers table? Is this due to data integration gaps, guest checkouts, or legacy data?
- Which table should serve as the primary source of truth for customer data to ensure consistency across sales, loyalty, and marketing analyses?

**Marketing Channel Attribution**
- How is the marketing_channel field captured in the dataset? Does it represent the customer’s first acquisition channel, or is it linked to the specific channel for each purchase?
- Is there a deterministic relationship between marketing_channel and account_creation_method? If so, should this fixed mapping be revisited to reflect multiple touchpoints in a customer journey?

**Loyalty Program Consistency**
- Is the loyalty_program flag assigned at the account level or on a per-order basis?
- Can a customer switch between loyalty and non-loyalty status across different purchases, or is membership status fixed once enrolled?
- What incentives are currently tied to the loyalty program, and are they dynamically adjusted based on purchase frequency?

### Assumptions and Caveats

- **Refund Records Completeness**: Refund data appears comprehensive, with both loyalty and non-loyalty customers showing a consistent overall refund rate of 10%. However, refund percentages held constant across loyalty tiers — this may indicate uniform return policies, but warrants validation with operational teams.

- **Deterministic Data Mapping**: A one-to-one relationship is observed between marketing channels and account creation methods, which limits insights on multi-channel impacts across a customer’s lifecycle. This static mapping may restrict advanced attribution modeling and should be verified with data engineering.

- **Loyalty Program Interpretation**: The dataset does not clarify whether the loyalty_program flag changes over time per customer. This ambiguity affects the analysis of repeat purchase behavior and loyalty-driven performance. Clarification is needed on whether a user’s loyalty status is permanent post-enrollment.
- **Attribution of Purchases to Channels**: Current data reflects only the initial account creation channel, not the channel directly influencing each transaction. This limits accurate channel-level sales attribution.
  - Direct Channel: Accounts for 83% of total sales.
  - Email Channel: Contributes 12% of sales, with a relatively higher AOV of $555.
  - Understanding if loyalty membership rates differ by channel would further enrich targeting strategies.
- **Unmatched Customer Records**: The potential presence of unmatched customer_ids across orders and customers tables may impact the robustness of join operations in SQL-based analyses.
- **Platform Performance Consistency**: The mobile app continues to underperform compared to the website — contributing only 2.6% of total sales with a lower AOV of $470. Future app enhancements could address this gap, but user engagement data by platform was not fully available in the current dataset.
