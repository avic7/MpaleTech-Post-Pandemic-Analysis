            <strong>Pandemic Surge and Peak Performance:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>2020 was the strongest year on record, with sales surging <strong>105%</strong> as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for home electronics.</li>
              <li>The company successfully captured the market shift, achieving its highest revenue milestones during this period.</li>

            <strong>Post-Pandemic Correction (2021-2022):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Following the 2020 peak, revenue began a downward trend, declining by <strong>8% in 2021</strong> and a further <strong>18% in 2022</strong>.</li>
              <li>Customer retention metrics have softened, with unique customers declining by 12% and repeat purchases dropping by 9%, signaling a need for re-engagement strategies.</li>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Volatility in Growth:</strong> While sales settled at $14.78M in 2022 still above pre-pandemic levels the trend line indicates a "return to mean" after the explosive 105% growth seen in 2020.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal Reliability:</strong> Seasonality remains a strong predictor, with consistent <strong>Q4 spikes (Nov–Dec)</strong> driven by holiday shopping events. Conversely, February and October consistently perform as the slowest months.</li>
    <li><strong>AOV Shift:</strong> Interestingly, while order volume dropped, the Average Order Value (AOV) climbed from <strong>$490 to $589</strong> (2019–2022). This suggests that while fewer customers are buying, they are purchasing significantly more expensive items.</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Opportunities:</strong> North America and Europe are saturated markets. Volatile growth in Asia and South America highlights an untapped opportunity for localized expansion strategies.</li>

      <h3>The Best and Worst (Sales)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The "Big Three" Dominance:</strong> JBL Live Pro+ Earbuds, Anker USB-C Chargers, and ASUS ProArt Displays are the titans of the catalog. Together, they account for <strong>72% of total revenue</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>The Revenue Leader:</strong> JBL Live Pro+ Earbuds alone contributed <strong>$19M (31% of revenue)</strong>, proving to be the brand's anchor product.</li>
        <li><strong>Volume vs. Value:</strong> The MacBook Air holds the title for highest order volume (28,398 units) but has a significantly lower AOV ($391) compared to the Anker and ASUS lines ($1,000+).</li>
        <li><strong>Underperformers:</strong> The Sony WH-1000XM5 and LG UltraFine 5K are currently dead weight, each contributing less than 1% to revenue.</li>

      <h3>AOV Analysis (Value)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Premium Outlier:</strong> The <strong>Anker USB-C Charger</strong> consistently drives the highest Average Order Value, peaking in 2022. This suggests it is likely purchased in bulk or high-value bundles.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable High-Performers:</strong> ASUS ProArt Displays and JBL Earbuds show consistent AOV growth year-over-year, reinforcing their role as reliable revenue pillars.</li>
        <li><strong>Laptop Positioning:</strong> Despite high sales volume, the MacBook Air sits in the middle tier for AOV. This indicates it is often a standalone purchase, unlike accessories which are frequently bundled.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-Impact Lines:</strong> LG Monitors and Sony Headphones consistently lag in AOV, mirroring their low overall revenue contribution.</li>

  <br>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue Resilience:</strong> Loyalty members have proven to be higher-value customers, maintaining an <strong>AOV of $551</strong> compared to $546 for non-loyalty members.</li>
    <li><strong>Stability in Downturns:</strong> While non-loyalty sales plummeted by <strong>23% in 2022</strong>, loyalty sales proved more resilient, dropping only 12%. Loyalty members offer a buffer against market volatility.</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum Loss:</strong> Despite early success (118% growth in 2020), the program has lost steam. The gap between loyalty and non-loyalty performance has narrowed post-pandemic, suggesting the incentives need a refresh.</li>
    <li><strong>Refund Neutrality:</strong> Participation in the loyalty program does not correlate with higher returns; refund rates remained a steady 10% across both cohorts.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Over-Reliance on Direct:</strong> The Direct channel is responsible for a staggering <strong>83% ($51.3M)</strong> of total revenue. While stable, this lack of diversification poses a risk.</li>

    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
    <h4>Based on the uncovered insights, here are actionable items that MapleTech can take away from our analysis.</h4>
      <ul>
        <h3>Product Strategy</h3>
        <li><strong>Capitalize on the "Big Three":</strong> Expand the inventory and bundling options for JBL, Anker, and ASUS products. Since they drive 72% of revenue, stockouts here are catastrophic.</li>
        <li><strong>Prune the Portfolio:</strong> Deprioritize inventory for the Sony and LG lines (under 1% revenue). Reallocate marketing spend from these low-yield items to high-AOV winners.</li>
        <h3>Customer Retention</h3>
        <li><strong>Win-Back Campaigns:</strong> Address the 12% decline in unique customers by launching aggressive re-engagement campaigns targeting users who purchased in 2020 but haven't returned.</li>
        <li><strong>Loyalty 2.0:</strong> Refresh the loyalty program incentives. Since loyalty members spend $5 more per order and are more resilient to downturns, moving just 10% of non-loyalty users to this tier would significantly impact the bottom line.</li>
        <h3>Channel Optimization</h3>
        <li><strong>Diversify Acquisition:</strong> Reduce the 83% reliance on Direct traffic. Invest in Affiliate and Social Media partnerships to build a more robust, multi-channel funnel.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix the App:</strong> The Mobile App is underperforming (2.6% share). Conduct a UX audit to identify why AOV is $80 lower on mobile than on desktop and streamline the checkout flow.</li>
        <h3>Regional Expansion</h3>
        <li><strong>Go Global:</strong> With North America and Europe saturated, target the "volatile but growing" markets in Asia and South America with localized pricing and marketing to capture new market share.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2 align="center">Questions, Assumptions and Caveats</h2>

  <h3>Questions for Stakeholders</h3>
  
  <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a91775-d202-42b9-a29f-84ee8bb64e60" width="800" />
  </div>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unmatched Records:</strong> What percentage of orders lack a corresponding <code>customer_id</code>? Determining the "Source of Truth" table is critical for accurate retention analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribution Logic:</strong> Is the <code>marketing_channel</code> field static (first touch) or dynamic (last touch)? The current data suggests a static relationship, which may mask multi-channel effectiveness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Assumptions and Caveats</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Refund Records:</strong> Refund data appears comprehensive (10% avg), but the consistent percentages across tiers suggest a potential data artifact that warrants validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Performance:</strong> The mobile app's underperformance is assumed to be a UX issue, but could also be related to a difference in user demographics on that platform.</li>
  </ul>
